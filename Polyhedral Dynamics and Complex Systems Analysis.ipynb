    "## Abstract\n",
    "Polyhedral dynamics, more commonly known as [Q-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-analysis) is a mathematical framework for describing and analyzing the structural properties of relations between sets. It was originally developed to study the structure and dynamics of social systems ([Atkin, 1972](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020737372800294)), but because of its roots in algebraic topology, q-analysis can be generalized to deal with a wide range of complex systems. It has been applied to the study of chess ([Atkin & Witten, 1977](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020737375800356)), urban transportation systems ([Johnson, 1981](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/b080141), Johnson, 1984), topic analysis ([Jacobson & Yan, 1998](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1004255229611?LI=true), [Rodrigues, 2013](http://oro.open.ac.uk/42634/)), multi-criteria decision making ([Heissl et. al., 1985](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0096300385900219), [Chin et. al., 1991](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009630039190019J), [Duckstein & Nobe, 1997](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221797003081), [Bhattacharyya & Chakraborty, 2015](http://growingscience.com/dsl/Vol4/dsl_2014_33.pdf)),, multiplexity in entrepreneurship networks ([Bliemel et. al.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/35771791/2014_Multiplexity.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1513826618&Signature=1prc261i%2BsslmGqYDcGSg6RoSXU%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DAn_Integrated_Approach_to_Studying_Multi.pdf)), and developing expert systems for medical diagnostics. This notebook presents some of the basic concepts and methods for computing topological structures using the q-analysis system developed by Ron Atkin. The notebook covers several key concepts from q-connectivity, q-transmission, eccentricity, and traffic. The concepts and methods provide some of the initial building blocks for developing 'intelligent' systems, and serve as the basic building blocks for constructing multi-level complex systems that can be used in multi-criteria decision-making and analysis.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The foundations for graph theory (and later topology) were first developed by the mathematician, Leonard Euler in 1736 when he tackled the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem. Euler's task was to identify a route where one could walk through the city while crossing all seven bridges once, and only once. Although a problem of little consequence, the Seven Bridges presented an interesting challenge, as the mathematics of the day were ill-suited to solving the problem. Euler realized that the problem was not a counting problem or workable using standard Euclidian geometry.\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead, Euler devised a way to define the 'geometry of position' by reducing the problem system to its invariant properties, as a set of vertices (land masses) and edges (bridges) resulting in a graph that could be easily inspected. Euler proved that it was impossible for a person to walk across all seven bridges in single circuit of the city. Euler's solution laid the groundwork for an entirely new branch of mathematics, known as algebraic or combinatorial topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although topology has been around in some form for nearly 300 years, the field has exploded in the last 60 years. Mathematician and researchers both have utilized topological methods to tackle a number of complex problems, leading to major breakthroughs in physics, geography, computer science, neuro-sciences, urban planning and design, and even artificial intelligence ([Carlsson, 2009](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/S0273-0979-09-01249-X.pdf), [Johnson 2014](http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p533)). Topology has also influenced scientific discoveries related to the function and structure of complex systems, swarm intelligence, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polyhedral dynamics represents one of the major innovations of topology that arose during the last 60 years of development. Based primarily on the work of Ron Atkin ([Atkin, 1972](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020737372800294), [Atkin & Casti 1977](http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/709/)), polyhedral dynamics offers a mathematical system capable of describing and analyzing the structural and dynamic properties of relations between sets of simplicies and vertices. The combinatorial connectives linking simplicies and vertices form the simplicial complex as a representation of a multi-dimensional system upon which the dynamical behavior of the system can be directly inspected.\n",

    "\n",
    "More recent developments in hypernetwork theory ([Johnson 2006](http://oro.open.ac.uk/4628/); [2014](http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p533); [2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjst/e2016-02653-4)) greatly expand the application space of q-analysis by providing a formalism for describing n-ary relations, and ordered set. The expansion beyond the binary relation opens up new avenues for studying complex systems, including multi-level systems of systems where space and time (as position in time) are but two dimensions in an n-dimensional topological space. These additions also present some interesting opportunities for exploring topological approaches to artificial intelligence, particularly, knowledge representation such ontological engineering, classification and complex multi-attribute decision-making, and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the purposes of this notebook, we will simply review some of the basic foundations of the algebraic system, as this will provide a reusable reference for the development and experimentation of polyhedral systems to study language, innovation, markets, and eventually intelligence."

    "## Foundations\n",
    "The foundation of polyhedral dynamics rests on the principles of algebraic topology and simplicial homology theory (Casti) to extract the topological invariants of a simplicial complex representing a given system under investigation. Constructing the system complex is based on defining the relation between two well-defined sets given a set of values describing the character of the relation. For example, the relation defined between some set A and another set B produce observable geometric properties e.g. simplicies, vertices, edges and faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "![\\lambda \\subseteq A \\cdot  B](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Gpnv-YekDt4/WW1WGy5X3mI/AAAAAAAAEl4/ooxYG0h1k6cbF-sUT6CG1cGvjDjgHs8qgCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-07-17%2Bat%2B5.25.43%2BPM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplicial complex reveals the structural character of data based on a relational mapping between A and B, for a given threshold or slicing parameter \\theta that determine the conditions under which elements in the system are retained or dropped. Given this slicing parameter, the relational mapping produces in an incidence matrix that highlight the connectivities between set A (the collection of simplicies), and set B (the collection of vertices) that describe each individual simplex.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a computational framework, constructing the incidence matrix relies on defining three specific elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A data matrix, \n",
    "2. A label set (A) representing the rows in the matrix, and \n",
    "3. A label set (B) representing the columns in the matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two or more additional sets can be included to compute weighted relations and dynamical properties over the complex. For sake of simplicity, we will focus on the two sets and the data matrix which are defined below as two flat Python lists and one 2-d list. Of course, if requiring greater computational efficiency, these data could be defined as  [numpy arrays](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/quickstart.html).\n",

    "Although these data are arbitrary, elements in the label sets could be nearly anything we can formally name. The simplex set A could represent entities such as towns, organizations, concepts, people, buildings and so forth, while the vertex set could represent the attributes used to describe these entities such as the services, cultural practices, language, buildings, and/or governance structures associated with a town or organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, perhaps we might want to compute a structure and system for studying the dynamics of risk and resilience in coastal communities in the Pacific Northwest. In our hypothetical system, we might want to identify the relation between the physical, social, economic, and cultural attributes of coastal communities. Once the elements of the system have been identified and the connectives between entities in the system well-established, we can include additional the vertices representing disturbance parameters. Disturbance features could include coastal inundation from storm surge events, and coastal erosion leading to loss of property and/or infrastructure. Using these connectives, we could then also compute the time-to-recovery, and together would provide a window into the combined interactions between coastal disturbance events and the function of community structure on local resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we could define an entirely different use-case example. For instance, the simplex set could be organizational units at a university, and the vertices representing the skills or expertise of each unit. Say we want to study the units to assess topic coverage for a field of study, and identify opportunities for cross-unit collaboration. Similarly, the system can be described and experimented with to assess the impact of skill or expertise-specific hires (or fires) on the potential for interdisciplinary - cross-unit research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing the Incidence Matrix\n",
    "In each case, we can define a rather complex system using a very simple set of data structures. For instance, the construction of the incidence matrix representing the system is based on the mapping rule for connecting the two label sets given the date values in the matrix. In this case, the threshold parameter mentioned earlier serves to define which elements are retained and which are ignored. In this example, we might define a threshold value to equal 5 in which case all elements that are equal to or greater than 5 are given a value of 1, and all other values are given a value of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python function below provides a simple implementation of an incidence matrix constructor. It takes on only two parameters for constructing the new matrix; these include the data matrix, and the value of the slicing or threshold parameter. Using this function, it is possible to construct the incidence matrix given any threshold up to the maximal value in the matrix. In this example, the maximum slicing value possible is 7 as this is the maximum value used to describe a given relation between the two label sets.\n",

We can compute the list of simplicies and the vertices comprising each simplex, and inspect those relations through the get_simplex() function below. This function takes on several more parameters than the original IncidentB function -- these include the incidence matrix itself, as well as the two original label sets A & B along with the value for the slicing parameter used to construct the incidence matrix. Note that the 'get_simplex' function is not a necessary function for conducting q-analysis. However, it does provide a useful output for reviewing the relations between the two label sets.\n",

The column headers in the data table define the simplex by name, the number of vertices that describe that simplex, and the q-dimension of the simplex, which is the number of shared vertices - 1. The columns also show the slicing level and each of the vertices defined in the system. Values of zero mean that the simplex does not share that vertex. It is important to note that the q-dimension is a key attribute for structural analysis as will be seen shortly.\n",

This is simply computed by taking the transpose of the original matrix.

    "The next step in the procedure involves extracting the q-connected components that form the simplicial complex representing the entire system. At different levels of q, the structure of these components can and do change, allowing us to explore the system interactions at different dimensional levels. This is important feature of q-analysis in that by focusing on the connectivity of simplicies and the degree to which they are embedded in the system (simplicial complex) can be interpreted to identify control points, or critical failure points depending on the focus of analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The q_components() function below is used to extract the components (complexes) that describe the system at a given q-level. It is important to note that at this time that our analysis is focused on first identifying q-near and q-connected simplicies, as these features are central parameters to computing 'traffic' patterns over the complex. But before we proceed it is necessary to define and differentiate these two terms in the context of our analysis. Simplicies that are q-near are defined by the fact that the simplicies share at least one vertex. On the other hand, a q-connected simplicies may not share a vertex, but instead can be connected to another simplex in which the two original simplicies share at least one vertex. So, in this way, a simplicies might be q-connected, but not q-near.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis on q-connected components will become clearly when computing dynamic traffic patterns over the complex as the q-connected components provide a window into available pathways for spread of a particular event. This spreading phenomenon is called q-transmission and is a central feature in the q-analysis system. For instance, in our hypothetical example of academic units at a university, the measure of q-connectivity could be used to measure the level of integration between skills and units to accomplish a given task. By removing a given person from a unit, we might find that an obstruction occurs where a particular person and skill-set severed to link the unit to other units in the university. Q-transmission provides a measure of the impact on the system as members of each unit attempt to connect and collaborate. It might also be used to assess the likely collaborators at person level and at the unit level. Again, what is important to remember here is that the q-connectivity provides one of the initial measures for computing the q-transmission of events or behavior over the system.\n",

Yet first, we must identify the connected components to assess the level of connectivity that ultimately determine transmission behavior.\n",

This means that information, resources for whatever our focus of analysis is, can move freely across the complex without obstruction.

    "## Mapping Traffic\n",
    "The description and analysis of dynamics of a simplicial complex in the polyhedral system is addressed through the concept of 'traffic.' While most general concepts of traffic relate to movement of objects, traffic in this context simply denotes the presence of something existing over the 'backcloth' or complex. The complex provides the structure for determining the potential flow of entities. The road system on which cars travel represents the complex or backcloth. As a rule-of-thumb, vehicles do not deviate from the built roadway, and instead follow the networked pathway to reach a given destination. If places of interest are fragmented, then it may be, structurally speaking inaccessible, meaning the gaps (q-holes) serve as obstructions to the existence of traffic, limiting or eliminating accessibility to a given location in the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping of traffic is typically an easy mapping of simplicies into a set of integers representing the value for a given traffic at a specified dimension. This allows us to extend the original matrix by constructing a new set that can be evaluated. Additionally, the mapping of integers could be multiplied by a given set of weights based on some theoretical or preference ordering. This enables q-analysis to serve as a decision-aide in multi-criterion decision-making (see: Duckstein and Nobe, 1997).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example here, we will start by creating two new sets that represent pre and post values. These two sets of integers will be used to measure change in traffic over the complex."

Here, simplex A has a negative t-force of 3, meaning that information or value is moving away from the simplex. On the other hand, simplex D has an attractive t-force of 10, meaning D is a possible sink or destination for information flows.\n",

    "This opens up new possibilities in which we can use the q-analysis system to compute the dynamics of the system (complex). However, the dynamics of flow are difficult to measure by focusing only on the traffic values, as they do not tell us anything about where the information is flowing, or how it is being obstructed in the system. Moreover, one of the benefits of systems modeling is the ability to experiment with different policies and to assess who those policies affect and effected by the structure of the system. Up to this point we have focus primarily on describing the system using algebraic methods. In order to study the dynamics of flow or change, and the impact of traffic on the complex and vice versa, we need to introduce another new concept, 'q-Transmission.'"

    "## Computing Transmission\n",
    "In this notebook, I adopted Johnson's formal specification of the q-Transmission property. Q-transmission defines the relationship between the complex and the 'movement' or change in traffic as t-forces as indicated above. However, to this point we have focused primarily on system level properties with the exception of eccentricity measures. In Johnson's q-transmission theory, we focus on defining transmission fronts, the shared faces that allow movement of something from one simplex to another. Up to this point we have focused on computing q-connectivity as a general property of the system, but q-transmission relies on computing the q-near components, where a pair of simplicies share one or more vertices. While a pair of simplicies might be q-connected, it is not guaranteed that they are also q-near. For example, in our q-component at q = 0, all simplicies are q-connected. Yet, this does not tell us about flow at a given point of time. Now, there is a whole discussion about clock time versus social time and so on, but for now I will save this for a later date.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we will simply consider the movement of information from one simplex to another given a shared vertex. This means traffic at 0-q can move directly from the point of origin (simplex) to another simplex sharing that vertex at t+1, where t = 0. This shared vertex represents the transmission 'front.' The traffic that is now present at a given simplex (t = 1) can move to other simplicies that are q-near. This movement can continue through q-near simplicies, and eventually the entire q-connected complex. The function below provides a starting point for computing the q-transmission values for any pair of simplicies."

    "The output above highlights the dimension and the q-near simplicies at that dimension. For example, at the dimension 0.0 A is q-near to 'D', 'B', 'C', 'E', 'H', 'I', 'L', meaning that A shares at least 1 vertex with each of these simplicies. This is also means that information or traffic defined by 0-dimension can exist on any one of these simplicies where t=1. Additionally, this indicates that the number of transmission fronts of A at 0-dimension are 2 or greater, where A = F_sub_0, 'D', 'B', 'C', 'E', 'H', 'I', 'L' = F_sub_1, and 'F', 'G', 'J', 'K' = F_sub_2 or greater.\n",
    "The value of -1 in the dimension key of the dictionary represent simplicies (F', 'G', 'J', 'K') that do not share a common vertex with the simplex under consideration. However, as indicated previously, these simplicies still may be q-connected and our goal of computing the transmission fronts for each simplex begins by traversing the q-near simplicies until all q-near simplicies have been exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple way for computing the transmission fronts from the q-near simplicies is to consider all sets of simplicies and their q-near relations to determine if elements in -1 of A are in 0 of any other simplex except themselves. If so, then the simplex in -1 of A that is also 0 or more of another simplex, and that is also in 0 of A results in a transmission number of F = 2. Similarly, there are situations where a simplex might be many fronts away from another simplex and still be q-connected. Such a hypothetical system might start at A and move from B to C to D to reach L. In this case pair of simplicies A and L have transmission front number of F = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this idea of transmission can be further defined by returning our focus to the conjugate complex of the incidence matrix. By focusing on the vertices, we can compute the exactly the links between each simplex and model the flows from one simplex to another based on a specific vertex or set of vertices. Johnson describes this process in the context of modeling traffic dynamics in transportation network where roads represent vertices links between junctions on-ramps or roundabouts that represent the nodes or simplicies. To model the flow of traffic, Johnson focused on measuring movement and identifying choke points in the system, the nodes. Here traffic can accumulate leading to roadway congestion, or flow freely indicating open roadways. It is important to note this example as Johnson explicitly models the links as fundamental properties of the system, but nearly anything could be described in this way where we would want to measure flows both locally and globally over the complex."

    "## Concluding Remarks\n",
    "At this point, there is still some work to do to fully flesh out the q-transmission functions, but at this point we already have a rather powerful system for modeling a range of complex multi-dimensional systems. Additionally, these methods can be combined to construct multi-criterion decision-making tools, where decision options are ranked as a decision or project satisfaction index based upon the number of shared vertices and given set of weights for those vertices. But for now, this example will be left for another date. Overall, this notebook provides a functional implementation for the study of complex systems using q-analysis or polyhedral dynamics. Furthermore, it provides a starting point for constructing hierarchical systems models using Johnson's hypernetwork theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are already being applied to study impacts and mitigation strategies to combat sea level rise and storm surge inundation in coastal communities, and is now also being used to study the impact of supply chain disruptions on short, mid and long-term value of businesses. Because these methods and resulting computational system are so flexible, I will be committing significant time to refining the computing framework, as well as applying this system to a number of interesting use cases, particularly for application related to artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to broaden the application scope and support greater adoption of the methodology will require additional functionality. First, the q-transmission properties need to complete, as they represent a type of accumulator function that could be applied to automated learning. Second, there is need to spend time on the process of set construction. This is more of a methodological issue rather than a computing issue, yet it is fundamental, after all, garbage in, garbage out. Third, the current system lacks useful visual functions. Thus, next steps will focus primarily on improving the q-transmission computations and increase the number of visualization options associated with the system, and these improvements will be communicated using some examples for set construction."
